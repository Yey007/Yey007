# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Utku. I'm a sophomore at Cornell Engineering and am aspiring to get a degree in computer science with a minor in robotics. I'm also on the autonomy subteam of the [Cornell Electric Vehicles](https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/) project team.

I'm currently working on... a touch too many things. Feel free to look around! And if you find anything interesting, please do get in touch at [contact@utku.sh](mailto:contact@utku.sh).
