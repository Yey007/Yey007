# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Utku. I'm a freshman at Cornell Engineering and am aspiring to get a degree in computer science with a minor in robotics within the next four years. In addition to the projects you see, I worked on the Portal project at the [Youth Passion Project](https://www.youthpassionproject.org/) and was the programming lead on FTC team 12331, the [Scarsdale Robo Raiders](https://www.scarsdalerobotics.com/). I hope to join a project team at Cornell so I can further my passion for robotics.

I'm currently working on... a touch too many things. However, my main project is motorizing my camera slider using an Arduino and an accompanying Flutter app. I'm also learning Erlang, and working on my Redstone computer from time to time.
