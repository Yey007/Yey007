# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Utku. I'm currently in my senior year of high school and am aspiring to get a CS degree in the next four years! In addition to the projects you see, I work on the Portal project at the [Youth Passion Project](https://www.youthpassionproject.org/) and am the programming lead on FTC team 12331, the [Scarsdale Robo Raiders](https://www.scarsdalerobotics.com/).
