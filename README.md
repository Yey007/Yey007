Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===

I'm Utku. I'm a freshman at Cornell Engineering and am aspiring to get a degree in computer science with a minor in robotics within the next four years. In addition to the projects you see, I worked on the Portal project at the [Youth Passion Project](https://www.youthpassionproject.org/) and was the programming lead on FTC team 12331, the [Scarsdale Robo Raiders](https://www.scarsdalerobotics.com/). I'm currently in CS 2110 at Cornell, and I hope to join a project team so I can further my interest in robotics.

I'm currently working on... a touch too many things. However, my main project is motorizing my camera slider using an Arduino and an accompanying app.
