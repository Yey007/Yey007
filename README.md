Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===

I'm Utku. I'm a freshman at Cornell Engineering and am aspiring to get a degree in computer science with a minor in robotics within the next four years. I'm currently in CS 2800 and CS 3110 at Cornell, and I'm also on the autonomy subteam of the [Cornell Electric Vehicles](https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/) project team.

I'm currently working on... a touch too many things. However, my main project is motorizing my camera slider using an Arduino and an accompanying app.
